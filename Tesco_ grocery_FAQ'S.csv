If you have purchased an item that’s part of a multi-buy offer or meal deal and we send a substitute that is more expensive, the price of the deal may increase. If you don’t want to pay the extra cost, you can choose to refuse all the items picked for the deal and get a refund instead.

,Online Grocery FAQs,Alcohol rules and regulations in Scotland and Wales,Minimum unit pricing,"The Minimum Unit Price sets a price point below which a unit of alcohol cannot legally be sold by retailers in Scotland or Wales. It has been implemented by the Scottish and Welsh Governments to reduce alcohol consumption and related harm.
This means that some alcoholic beverages are priced higher in Scotland and Wales than elsewhere in the UK because retailers are legally required to price alcoholic beverages above the Minimum Unit Price threshold.
"
,Online Grocery FAQs,Alcohol rules and regulations in Scotland and Wales,Tesco prices compared with other retailers,"The Scottish Government introduced Minimum Unit Pricing into legislation to reduce alcohol-related harm. This means from 2 March 2020 all retailers are legally required to follow the Minimum Unit Pricing legislation on alcohol. Wherever possible, our prices will remain competitive, and we will continue to focus on offering quality products. Visit mygov.scot for more information.

"

,Online Grocery FAQs,Alcohol rules and regulations in Scotland and Wales,Why large beer and cider packs are no longer available,"The decision was taken to remove large packs of beer and cider from the Scottish and Welsh ranges because the minimum price of large packs would make them much more expensive for customers. Instead, we have introduced mid-sized packs, so the entry price is lower."
,Online Grocery FAQs,Alcohol rules and regulations in Scotland and Wales,Calculating minimum unit pricing,"The formula used to calculate minimum unit pricing is, price per unit of alcohol (£) x strength of alcoholic drink (ABV) x volume of alcoholic drink (L) = £. Where it’s not a whole number, any calculations must be rounded up to the nearest penny, as rounding down would make it below Minimum Unit Pricing. You can check this Minimum Unit Pricing calculator for more details.
More details are available on the Welsh Government website.
"
,Online Grocery FAQs,Alcohol rules and regulations in Scotland and Wales,Why only certain prices have increased,"We have only increased the prices of alcohol products that were below the Minimum Unit Pricing, as required by law.

,Online Grocery FAQs,Product specific information,Temporary sunflower oil changes,"The war in Ukraine has affected supplies of sunflower oil. To allow food products made with sunflower oil to remain on sale, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland (FSS) have advised producers to replace sunflower oil with other vegetable oils, such as refined rapeseed oil, without changing labels.
The FSA/FSS have advised that allergic reactions to rapeseed oil are very rare.
We are changing our labels as quickly as possible but some foods products which usually contain sunflower oil may instead contain refined rapeseed oil.
Further advice is available on: FSA Advice on Sunflower Oil and FSS Advice on Sunflower Oil. These changes will come into effect immediately.

If other vegetable oils richer in saturated fat are used, we will update our labels to reflect any change in nutrient content of the product as soon as possible."
,Online Grocery FAQs,Product specific information,Safety and allergy issues of replacing sunflower oil,"The FSA/FSS have reviewed the food safety risk of substituting sunflower oil with refined rapeseed oil and confirmed it’s very low. They have advised that allergic reactions to rapeseed oil are very rare and, if they do occur, are mild.
Customer safety is very important to us, and we will comply with all food safety guidelines. Allergens will always be clearly highlighted in bold on the label of Tesco own-brand foods. If the allergens in a product change, we will always update the ingredients list and add an ’Allergy Update’ logo to the front label.
